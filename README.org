* Introduction
** Installation
   - Install [[https://revealjs.com/][reveal.js]]
   - Activate ~org-re-reveal-ref~
     - Place this directory into your load path or install it from
       [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][MELPA]]
     - Load package manually (~M-x load-library~ followed by
       ~org-re-reveal-ref~) or place ~(require 'org-re-reveal-ref)~ into your
       "~/.emacs" and restart
   - Load an Org file and export it to HTML
     - Make sure that reveal.js is available in your current directory
       (e.g., as sub-directory or symbolic link)
     - Load "README.org" (coming with org-re-reveal-ref)
     - Export to HTML: Press ~C-c C-e v v~ (write HTML file) or
       ~C-c C-e v b~ (write HTML file and open in browser)

** Rationale
   - Teaching resources should be free and open
     - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources][Open Educational Resources (OER)]]
     - See cite:HWS+10 for technical and legal requirements
   - My requirements (see cite:Lec19)
     - (Re-) Usable with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software][FLOSS]]
     - Following paradigm of single sourcing (see cite:Roc01)
     - Platform independent, also offline use

* Reveal.js presentations
** Org-re-reveal
   - [[https://gitlab.com/oer/org-re-reveal/][Org-re-reveal]] provides
     [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] export functionality to
     generate HTML presentations with
     [[https://revealjs.com/][reveal.js]]
     - See cite:SD11 for an introduction to Org mode
   - Such presentations offer lots of features
     - Themes, animations, and slide transitions
     - Speaker’s view with preview, notes, and timer
     - Embedding of images, audio, video, mathematical formulas
     - Many more

** Org-re-reveal-ref
   - This package adds support for citations and bibliography to
     ~org-re-reveal~
   - Use citations of [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]]
     as usual
     - With export to reveal.js and PDF

* Conclusions
** Summary
   - Use ~cite~ commands as usual
   - Insert bibliography on separate slide with ~printbibliography~
     - See next slide
     - Important: You must use a ~CUSTOM_ID~ on that slide, whose
       value is that of customizable variable ~org-re-reveal-ref-bib~
